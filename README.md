# Expresso-Churn-Prediction
- The data was from Expresso Churn Prediction competition on Zindi

- The "EDA and Keras API" notebook contains the exploratory Data Analysis and prediction model using the Keras API from Tensorflow
- The "Functional API" notebook contains the prediction Mosel using Tensorflow's Functional API and Tensorflow Serving
- Some disparities will be there because of difference in data preparation methods between the Keras API and the Functional API
